Serialization is something to be made in a sequence of bytes or symbols

BSON - byte, binary serialization
JSON - text serialization
XML - text serialization
Binary xml - byte serialization

binary serialization - is more efficient, more compact
text serialization - is easier for inspecting, 
more readable, goes through firewalls, because can be expected exactly what 
is going through
, better for debugging ,better for  logging


text serialization of JSON and XML is extensible -  old services can work with the new data,
which have more fields

When new fields are added in the JSON/XML the old services will continue to work only
with the old fields with which they have been working before, the new fields will be ignored


In general

Business logic should be in the domain servise

Representation ans serialization of data should be in the web service/ web controller

Persisting and mapping of object to the database  should be in he dao layer / repository layer

Only the @Expose fields are serialized
