@Entity
@Data
@Table(name = "shampoos")
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Shampoo {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)
    private long id;
    private String brand;
    private double price;

    @Enumerated(ORDINAL)
    private Size size;

    // optional = true - There might not exist a label for the shampoo
    @ManyToOne(optional = true, cascade = )
    private Label label;
}

When we have ManyToOne the cascade should NOT be All,
if it is All when we delete 1 Shampoo it will delete its Label, which is shared among many Shampoos
// If CascadeType.Persist is used. when a shampoo with a Label is created, the Label will be Persisted also
